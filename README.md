# Awesome README [![Awesome](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sindresorhus/awesome@d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)]
This website is created becuase I want more people to know algorithm might look difficult but they could be beautiful when visualized. During my study on sorting and path-finding algorithm, I always find graph and visualization gif helps a lot for me to comprehend them. At the beginning of my bootcamp Flatiron, I saw Clement Mihailescu did a website of visualization, this trigers me that whenever I am ready for a complicate website I will do this one. Last phase is the time.

This website delivered below features
Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
Astar Search* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
Wall system, inside Dijkstra's page, I enable the custom wall feature that you can use mouse to create wall by your self.
Random maze, inside Astar page, I enable random maze so you could see how Astar looks for target in a more efficient way.
